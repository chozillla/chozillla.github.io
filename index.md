## Chemay Shola
Hello,

I am a senior at the University of Washington studying bioengineering. I am interested in wearable technology, specifically hearables. Currently, I am working in [Dr. Yi Shen's](https://sphsc.washington.edu/content/yi-shen) lab on an open sourced hearable project.  Here is my [LinkedIn profile].(https://www.linkedin.com/in/chemayshola/)I plan on continuing my education to the docterate level with the aspiration of becoming a researcher and a professure. 
I have always been fascinated with sound growing up as a musician. 



### Personal 

In my spare time I like to run and bike. Here is my [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43295938). I also am learning how to play the acoustic guitar with plans of learning electric as well. Another hobby I'd love to spend more time is climbing!
